    <p>   I am a professional and dedicated full-stack web developer of over 5 years, 
    with experience in frameworks such as Angular, AngularJS, ReactJS and vue.js. 
    </p>

<p> My multidisciplinary experiences include working as a functional analyst and DevOps, from design to project deployment - both with smaller groups led by myself and in larger cross-continental development teams - including working remotely from home.
</p>

<p>In my own time I like to scour GitHub code repositories and keep up to date with all the latest technology and development announcements, some of my favorite blogs include Hackernoon, Hacker News and dev.to.</p>
